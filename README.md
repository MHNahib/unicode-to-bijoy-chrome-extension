# Unicode to Bijoy Converter

## Converts Unicode text to Bijoy ANSI and copies to clipboard.

This Chrome extension is based on the converter originally developed by [Md. Elias Hossain](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ngelias/?originalSubdomain=bd) and the functionalities defined by the [Ministry of Land](https://bsbk.portal.gov.bd/apps/bangla-converter/index.html). It allows you to convert Unicode text to Bijoy ANSI, a popular encoding for Bengali text, and automatically copies the converted text to your clipboard.

The extension was created out of personal interest to provide a convenient tool for users who prefer Bijoy ANSI encoding for typing and displaying Bengali text.
